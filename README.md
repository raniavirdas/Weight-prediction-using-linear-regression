# Weight-prediction-using-linear-regression
It is one of my studi independen projects at PT.Orbit Ventura Indonesia. It will predict weight in kilograms for the input of height and gender given in the web interface. The web interface is done using the flask framework. I use a simple linear regression model to predict body weight.
